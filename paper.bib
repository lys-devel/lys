After photoexcitation by a 190 fs pulse, we observe diffraction intensity oscillations with periods of 35 and 75 ps, which indicate coherent acoustic phonons of two distinct branches. The oscillations of  and  diffraction intensities have opposite signs, indicating the change of the diffraction angle due to the shear strain. By numerically simulating these diffraction intensities as a function of the monoclinic angle, we evaluate the amplitude of the photo-induced shear strain.}

    abstract = "{In this paper, we investigate the femtosecond-optical-pulse-induced strain dynamics in relatively thin (100 nm) and thick (10 000 nm) silicon plates based on finite-element simulations. In the thin sample, almost spatially homogeneous excitation by the optical pulse predominantly generates a standing wave of the lowest-order acoustic resonance mode along the out-of-plane direction. At the same time, laterally propagating plate waves are emitted at the sample edge through the open edge deformation. Fourier transformation analysis reveals that the plate waves in the thin sample are mainly composed of two symmetric Lamb waves, reflecting the spatially uniform photoexcitation. In the thick sample, on the other hand, only the near surface region is photo-excited and thus a strain pulse that propagates along the out-of-plane direction is generated, accompanying the laterally propagating pulse-like strain dynamics through the edge deformation. These lateral strain pulses consist of multiple Lamb waves, including asymmetric and higher-order symmetric modes. Our simulations quantitatively demonstrate the out-of-plane and in-plane photoinduced strain dynamics in realistic silicon plates, ranging from the plate wave form to pulse trains, depending on material parameters such as sample thickness, optical penetration depth, and sound velocity.}",

abstract = {The unique life cycle of the skyrmions was precisely tracked by pump-probe Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Magnetic skyrmions are self-organized topological spin textures that behave like particles. Because of their fast creation and typically long lifetime, experimental verification of skyrmion’s creation/annihilation processes has been challenging. Here, we successfully track skyrmion dynamics in defect-introduced Co9Zn9Mn2 by using pump-probe Lorentz transmission electron microscope. Following the nanosecond photothermal excitation, we resolve 160-nm skyrmion’s proliferation at \&lt;1 ns, contraction at 5 ns, drift from 10 ns to 4 μs, and coalescence at ~5 μs. These motions relay the multiscale arrangement and relaxation of skyrmion clusters in a repeatable cycle of 20 kHz. Such repeatable dynamics of skyrmions, arising from the weakened but still persistent topological protection around defects, enables us to visualize the whole life of the skyrmions and demonstrates the possible high-frequency manipulations of topological charges brought by skyrmions.}

abstract  ="Ultrafast optical control of strain is crucial for the future development of nanometric acoustic devices. Although ultrafast electron microscopy has played an important role in the visualization of strain dynamics in the GHz frequency region{,} quantitative strain evaluation with nm × ps spatio-temporal resolution is still challenging. Five-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (5D-STEM) is a powerful technique that measures time-dependent diffraction or deflection of the electron beam at the respective two-dimensional sample positions in real space. In this paper{,} we demonstrate that convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) measurements using 5D-STEM are capable of quantitative time-dependent strain mapping in the nm × ps scale. We observe the generation and propagation of acoustic waves in a nanofabricated silicon thin plate of 100 nm thickness. The polarization and amplitude of the acoustic waves propagating in the silicon plate are quantitatively determined from the CBED analysis. Further Fourier-transformation analysis reveals the strain distribution in the momentum-frequency space{,} which gives the dispersion relation in arbitrary directions along the plate. Versatility of 5D-STEM-CBED analysis enables quantitative strain mapping even in complex nanofabricated samples{,} as demonstrated in this study."
